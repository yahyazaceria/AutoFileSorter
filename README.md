# AutoFileSorter

AutoFileSorter is a simple Python script that automatically organizes your files by type.  
It moves PDFs, images, and screenshots into categorized folders inside your Documents directory, and moves development files into a separate `dev` folder.

---

## Features

- Sorts files from your Downloads folder (or any folder you specify)
- Moves:
  - PDFs to `Documents/pdfs`
  - Images to `Documents/images`
  - Screenshots to `Documents/screenshots`
  - Development files (e.g., `.py`, `.js`, `.html`, etc.) to a separate `dev` folder
- Easy to customize and extend

## How It Works

The script scans your source folder (e.g., Downloads), checks each fileâ€™s type, and moves it to the appropriate destination folder.
